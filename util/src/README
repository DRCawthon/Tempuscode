README for Tempus src/util dir

========================================


This dir contains various and sundry utilities intended for use
'offline'.  That is, they run independently of the MUD itself.

Some of the files have build directives in the main Makefile,
others expect to be compiled by hand, but there is no reason
that an entry could not be included in the Makefile.

The state of these files is in general UNKNOWN.  Typically, if
one is needed, the source should be examined and possibly modified
for compatibility.  This is because when structures and methods in
the main MUD code has changed, this code has not necessarily changed
with it.


========================================

The following subdirs have code of interest:

ped/		:	player-edit code.  Used to convert playerfiles
			when the char_file_u and related file structures
			must change

oed/		:	object-edit code.  Converts rentfiles.

hed/		:	house-edit code.  Converts house files.


As above, the current state and compatibility of these codes is UNKNOWN.
