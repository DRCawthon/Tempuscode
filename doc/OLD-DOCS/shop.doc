                              CircleMUD Shops

Summary:
   A description of the file format for CircleMUD shop files, which control
the shopkeepers within the CircleMUD world.

Intended Audience:
   Area creators.

NEW FORMAT:
CircleMUD v3.0 now has a new shop file format.  Since the old format
is still compatible, I've kept the old documetation at the end of
this file.  If you'd like to convert shop files in the old format to that
of the new format, compile and run the utility shopconv.  When writing new
files, you need to tell CircleMUD that the shopfile is in the new format
by including the following line BEFORE any shops in the file:

CircleMUD v3.0 Shop File~

The rest of the file is formatted as follows:

#<num>~
  Shop Number (Used only for display purposes)


<num 1>
<num 2>
<num 3>
  .
  .
  .
<num n>
-1
  These numbers refer to the objects the shop produces.  The numbers are
  virtual numbers.  The list MUST end with a -1.

<Profit when selling>
  The object value is multiplied by this value when sold. This is a
  floating point value. Must be >= 1.0

<Profit when buying>
  The object value is multiplied by this value when bought. This is a
  floating point value. Must be <= 1.0

<type 1>  [namelist 1]
<type 2>  [namelist 2]
<type 3>  [namelist 3]
  .
  .
  .
<type n>  [namelist n]
-1
  These lines contain the types of items that the shop will buy.  The first
  argument, called "type" is the type of item (see dbsup.doc).  Numerical,
  or english forms are valid (5 or WEAPON, 9 or ARMOR, etc)  In addition,
  you can provide optional keywords to give specific keywords that must
  be present on the item.  For further details on these expressions, see the
  notes following the new file format.  This list must be terminated by a -1.

<Message When Item to buy is non existing>~
<Message When item trying to sell is non existing>~
<Message When shop does not buy offered item>~
<Message when shop can't afford item>~
<Message when player can't afford item>~
<Message when keeper is selling an item>~
  Price is %d
<Message when keeper is buying an item>~
  Price is %d

<Temper>
  When player can't afford an item, the shopkeeper tells them they
  can't afford the item and then:
	0 - The shopkeeper pukes on the player.
	1 - The shopkeeper smokes his/her joint.
        2 - Shopkeeper spits over shoulder.
        3 - Shopkeeper farts on the player.
	other - No action besides message above.
        Got an idea?  It can be pimped with trivial hassle!

<Bitvector>
  Allows you to set certain values for the shop.
	WILL_START_FIGHT        1	/* Players can attack shopkeeper     */
	WILL_BANK_MONEY         2	/* Shopkeeper puts money > 15000
					   into the bank		     */

  A brief note:  Shopkeepers should be hard (if even possible) to kill.
  The benefits players can receive from killing them is enough to unbalance
  most non monty-haul campaigns.

<Shop Keeper Mobile Number>
  Virtual number of the shopkeeper.

<With Who>
  Designate certain alignments or classes that the shop will not
  trade with.  To determine this value, choose all elements on
  the list below that you do not want sold to, and add their values.

	TRADE_NOGOOD            1
	TRADE_NOEVIL            2
	TRADE_NONEUTRAL         4
	TRADE_NOMAGIC_USER      8
	TRADE_NOCLERIC          16
	TRADE_NOTHIEF           32
	TRADE_NOWARRIOR         64
        TRADE_NOBARB		128
	TRADE_NOKNIGHT		256
	TRADE_NORANGER		512

<Room 1>
<Room 2>
<Room 3>
   .
   .
   .
<Room n>
-1
  The virtual numbers the mobile must be in for the shop to be effective.
  (So trans'ed shopkeepers can't sell in the desert).  The list must be
  terminated by a -1.

  If This shopkeeper is to wander anywhere, be sure that the mob2_flag
  MOB2_SELLER is set on the shopkeeper himself.

<Time when open start 1>
<Time when open end 1>
   The hours between which the shop is open for first shift.

<Time when open start 2>
<Time when open end 2>
   The hours between which the shop is open for second shift.

  If only one shift, make time1 and time2 the same.


ITEM NAME LISTS:

Name lists are formed by boolean expressions.  The following operators
are available:

		',^ = Not		*, & = And	+, | = Or
	
The precedence is Parenthesis, Not, And, Or.  For example, the following line:

WEAPON [sword & long|short | warhammer | ^golden & bow] & magic

This shop will buy the following items of type WEAPON:
	1)	sword long magic
	2)	short magic	    (the first & is done before the first | )
	3)	warhammer magic
	4)	^golden bow magic

Note that the ^ in front of golden affects ONLY golden, and nothing else
in the listing.  Basically, the above expression could be written in
english as:

[(sword and long) or short or warhammer or (not golden and bow)] and magic

If I wanted the shop to only buy "short magic" only if they were also swords,
I would have to change the expression to:

WEAPON [sword & (long|short) | warhammer | ^golden & bow] & magic
                ^-Changes--^ 

You can also include object extra flags (listed in dbsup.doc).  The previous
example used "magic" as a keyword that had to be on the object.  If we wanted
to make it so that the MAGIC flag had to be set on the item, we would change
"magic" to "MAGIC."  Similar changes could be made to add other flags such as
"HUM" or "GLOW."  It should be noted that these expressions are case sensitive
and that all keywords should appear in lower-case, while the flag names should
be in all caps.


OLD FORMAT:
Default DIKU shop files have the following format:

#<xx>~
  Shop Number (Used only for display purposes)

<num1>
<num2>
<num3>
<num4>
<num5>
  These numbers refer to the objects the shop produces.
  The numbers are virtual numbers.

<Profit when selling>
  The object value is multiplied by this value when sold. This is a
  floating point value. Must be >= 1.0

<Profit when buying>
  The object value is multiplied by this value when bought. This is a
  floating point value. Must be <= 1.0

<num1>
<num2>
<num3>
<num4>
<num5>
  These five numbers are the item-types traded with by the shop.
  See dbsup.doc.

<Message When Item to buy is non existing>~
<Message When item trying to sell is non existing>~
<Message When wrong item-type sold>~
<Message when shop can't afford item>~
<Message when player can't afford item>~
<Message when buying an item>~
  Price is %d
<Message when selling an item>~
  Price is %d

<Temper>
  When player can't afford an item, the shopkeeper tells them they
  can't afford the item and then:
	0 - The shopkeeper pukes on the player.
	1 - The shopkeeper smokes his joint.
	other - No action besides message above.

<Bitvector>
  Allows you to set certain values for the shop:
	WILL_START_FIGHT        1	/* Players can attack shopkeeper     */
	WILL_BANK_MONEY         2	/* Shopkeeper puts money > 15000
					   into the bank		     */
