World File field description:
=============================
Main structure notes:
---------------------
<room_flags> are:
  A bitvector consisting of the room conditions as:
  DARK           a  Light must be used to see anything.
  DEATH          b  A player 'dies' (no xp lost) when entering.
                    It is a good idea to:
                     *Have these rooms light, because then EXITS will show
                      the room title, for example "In Boiling Water".
                     *Make exits to all rooms from which one can enter the
                      death_room, then the "death cry" will be heard by
                      other members of the group considering following...
  NO_MOB         c  No monsters may walk around in here
  INDOORS        d  This is inside (a house,cave or dungeon for example)
  PEACEFUL       e  Violent acts and spells will be supressed.
  SOUNDPROOF	 f  No communications take place into/out of room.
  !TRACK         g  Track doesn't work through this room.
  NO_MAGIC       h  Mages/Clerics cannot cast spells.
  TUNNEL         i  Only one char. at a time in room.
  PRIVATE        j  It is impossible to teleport to this room if it
                    already contains two characters.  The 'teleport'
		    spell will never teleport a player into this room.
  GODROOM        k  Super-private room: Immortals can not 'goto' this room.
            (l - p) DO NOT USE!!!!!
  NO_PSIONICS    q  Psychic abilities are useless.
  NO_SCIENCE     r  Physics cannot alter reality here.
  NO_RECALL      s  Recall spell cannot be used...
  CLAN_ROOM      t  Is a clan room
  ARENA		 u  
  DOCK	         v
  FLAME FILLED   w  Will set characters on fire if unprotected
  FREEZING       x  Chars will freeze to death if unprotected

<sector_type> is:
  This determines how many movement points are used when moving through
  a location of the type - use one of the numbers 0..7 (they are NOT the
  movement-points used - merely indexes to a lookup-table):

  SECT_INSIDE          0  Uses as if walking indoors
  SECT_CITY            1  Uses as if walking in a city
  SECT_FIELD           2  Uses as if walking in a field
  SECT_FOREST          3  Uses as if walking in a forest
  SECT_HILLS           4  Uses as if walking in hills
  SECT_MOUNTAIN        5  Uses as if climbing in mountains
  SECT_WATER_SWIM      6  Uses as if swimming
  SECT_WATER_NOSWIM    7  Impossible to swim water - requires a boat
  SECT_UNDERWATER      8  Underwater--need SCUBA or WATERBEATH
  SECT_FLYING          9  Requires POS_FLYING to enter
  SECT_NOTIME         10  Between times..Requires TIME_WARP to enter
  SECT_CLIMBING       11  Requires CLIMBING skills, or PITONS
  SECT_FREESPACE      12  Outer Space...Requires SPACE_SUIT
  SECT_ROAD	      13  On the road.
  SECT_VEHICLE	      14  Inside a car.
  SECT_CORNFIELD      15  ...
  SECT_SWAMP	      16  A marshy swamp.
  SECT_DESERT         17  Thirst becomes an important factor here...
  SECT_FLAME_RIVER    18
  SECT_JUNGLE         19
