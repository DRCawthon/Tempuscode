High Priority
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Implement house repossession
X Containers currently gain the weight of their contents each time they
  are rented
* Applies on eq don't seem to be stable at all
* Drink container's weight is 1lb/drink.  This is silly.
* Penalties for dying far exceed reasonable (at least in randomness).
* olc recalculate does not check CAN_EDIT
* Add recalculate "zone" for mob/object.
* Debug qcontrol system. ( doesn't save/load reliably )
* Cleave/Great-Cleave damage is too low and too consistant.


Low Priority
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add 'The Zen of <Centering/Dispassion/Detachment?>'

    ? Atropos sends player on a scavenger hunt and rewards the player
        with a crystal shuttle
    ? Laechesis challenges player to a battle to the death.  Upon her
        defeat, she leaves behind crystalline shears

    ? place each tool of the fates into crystal altar
    ? death ensues
    X select remortalization class

Under discussion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New combat system
	- Melee combat takes time to start if not sneaking or invis: can make
	  messages amusingly dependant on state
	  	"$n attacks you!" - normal
		"$n rushes in to attack you!" - hasted
		"$n slowly advances upon you!" - slowed
	- Time affected by haste, speed, slow
	- Maximum number of melee combantants to each single creature, dependant
	  on relative height
	- Chance to flee approaches 0 as number of combatants approaches maximum
	- Skills (rescue, retreat, charge) and spells (teleport, word of recall)
	  may bypass being surrounded
	- Ranged weapons/spells require no time to start combat
	- Ranged weapons at a disadvantage in close quarters
	- No maximum number of ranged combatants on one creature
	- Huge penalty for hitting non visible with ranged (zen archery for monks?)
	- Chance for ranged weapon to hit melee targets accidentally
	- Mage spell 'blink' teleports mage within room back to ranged combat from
	  current attackers
* skill 'parry' that blocks other special skills with weapon
	- weapon takes damage instead of self
	- might block behead, cleave, ... ?
* Support for accidentally hitting player without incurring penalties
	- for skills like berserk, id insinuation
* Quest related obj_data changes
    - Add player id ( and only that player can wear/wield/use )
    - Add '(protected)' flag or use player id to show '(protected)'
    - Add insurance company in E.C. that will both insure objects, and
      load a character's insured eq
* Keep track of mob vnums killed - adjust exp based on killing same mob
* Bounty Hunter
    - Kiosk in Skullport that sells 'bountys' on any player
    - Any player that kills the given player outside NVZ can
      return to the kiosk to accept the reward
    - On death, the special is notified who and where killed
      the target.
* Remove stradd
* AC changed to positive
* Race description file
* Class description file
