On the way to the FuNnY FaRm~
An unpaved gravel path leads up from the front gates the double
door entrance to an interestingly made building. Unable to quite
place the unsettling feeling in your stomach, or is just in your mind,
you carefully approach the door. To the right and left of the walkway,
a a garden can be found. Upon approaching the large double doors,
you notice a small on the door wich reads, "Welcome Home!"

The Garden~
A small fountain babbles patiently in the middle of a circular gravel
path. All along the side of the path gardenias, poppies, and other
flowers bloom. A wooden bench has been carefully placed among
the flowers facing the fountain.

The Reception Area~
As you enter this stale smelling room ,you notice that the decoration
here is pretty much bland. The dull monotonous music heard over
the loud speekers doesn't help much either. A spinster looking
woman with her black hair pulled tight into a bun gazes at you coldly
from behind a large wooden desk.

The Shock Therapy Room!~
A long, metal table with leather strap suitable for the hands and feet
stands in the middle of this porcelain tiled room. Several thick wires
lead from a small box attached to the wall. A single light 
shines down from the ceiling onto the table itself.

A Hallway~
This hallway used to have pure white walls to match the pure white
porcelain tiled floor. However, some madman has come along and 
spalatterd paint all over the place. Colors varying from neon yellow
to a deep midnight black are splayed precariously from the ceiling to
the floor and even on the ceiling and floor in some places.

The Elvis Ward~
As you creep through this crowded hallway, you notice a trend among
the patients -bad wigs topped with ugly, dark sunglasses and 
sequiend jump suits. Accidentally' you bump into one of the
residence who pipes up with "Thank You... Thank you very much."
He then wiggles his pelvis, does a Hoo-ahh!" and saunters away.
After a little while in this place, you're pretty sure you'll begin to
believe that Elvis didn't die...He's just visiting here from Pluto.

A Padded Cell~
They're coming to take me away... Ha-Ha! They're coming to take
me away... Ho-Ho! They're coming to take me away...Ha-ha-ho-ho-
he-he... To the FuNnY fArM where life is... What was that? Was that
your brain turning to mush? Or did you just lose an argument with
yourself... Again. Can't we all just get along?
Well in the meantime, this nicely-done floor to ceiling padded room will do just fine.
