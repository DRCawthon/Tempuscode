README file for Tempus src/Specs dir

========================================

This dir and it's subdirs contain the source code for most of the
special procedures.  They are grouped together pseudo-logically.

The source files all bear the .spec extension.  Furthermore, the
source files are not stand-alone C programs.  They are intended to
be included via the preprocessor directive #include in the spec_procs.c
file.
