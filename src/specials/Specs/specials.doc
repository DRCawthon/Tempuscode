Preface:

Special procedures provide life and flavor to the game.  Without them, the
game would be dull and boring.  With specials, you can create new challenges,
open new avenues for exploration, and make the game more interesting.  I claim
that a little Spec goes a long way.

Specs can be assigned to:
	1) Mobiles
	2) Objects
	3) Rooms

The special is a program, a procedure that is carried out on demand.
The Special program is called (ie, control is given to the program by
the game) under 2 circumstances:
	1) Any command is issued in the presence of the mob/obj/room
that is special.  For rooms, this is only when a char is in the room,
for mobs when the char is in the room with the mob, and objs when the 
obj is in_room/carried/worn.
	2) MOBILES ONLY:  Every 10 seconds, the mobiles are pulsed.  
This controls the mobile_activity, which makes mobs walk around, attack
other chars, pick up stuff, etc... It is from here that the mobile
special is also called.

Data structures used by the specials:
char_data, obj_data, and room_data.  refer to structs.doc for details.
When a character activates the special, the char_data struct is passed
to the special, and it is called ch.  To refer to the data structure
of the special mob/obj/room when the special is command-called, use
one of the following initialization formats at the top of the special:

struct char_data *guard = (struct char_data *) me;
struct obj_data *obj = (stuct obj_data *) me;
struct room_data *room = (struct room_data *) me;

Where guard, obj, and room are arbitrary names which you can choose.
NOTE:  When a mob special is called from the _pulse_ there is no need
for this initialization!  In this case, ch refers to the special MOB.

I. SECTION ONE:  Mobile Specials
While running the special, you may use any of the commands which are 
available to characters, as listed in "commands.doc".  Also, to make
data access easier, you may use macros as defined in "macros.doc".

To use a command from the command list, you must supply the char_data
struct of the char calling the command, as well as an argument and
the subcommand, if applicable.
